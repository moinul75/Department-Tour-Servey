# Department-Tour-Servey

 


**Problem Statement:** A department need current students infos for the upcoming tour plan and presentation group selected they want to take this in a pdf file. As it is not a technical department and most them in our country are not comfortable in creating pdf 
so this will create a problem for them. At this moment they feel they need a solution how can they do that. As I am working with modern technology , I think in myself get them solved this problem by creating a sytem which will take data from a form and make this data in a pdf file. As its more than couple of students so i also think all invidual files should be binding in a folder and in a zip format. I can share my thoughts with my department head  and my class cr. both of them take my idea and exited to see this implementation. There for I make this web application  and alhumdulillah its solved their problem and I am very happy to see that I can help others and make them happy by implementing my knowledge..

**Technology Used:** Html,Tailwind Css, Ajax , django , git for version contoll, django juzzmin,zipfile,pillow(for file handling) 

**Functionalities:**
 

**1. admin can logged in and see the infomation has all permission to do**
**2. User can see the form and able to submit their info once submit they will get the success alert message** 
**3. Amdin UI has a button for dwonlaod the zip file which is binding all the infos of indivisual pdf file**
